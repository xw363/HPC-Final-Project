#Final Project, High Performance Computing (NYU Spring 2015)

## Compile the programs
Check the followings before compiling the programs:

- fftw3 and CUDA toolkit are installed on your system.
- CUDA header directory is added to include path (`C_INCLUDE_PATH` and
`C_PLUS_INCLUDE_PATH`), and CUDA library directory is added to linking and
library path (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `LIBRARY_PATH`).
- The compilation flag `-lfftw3_omp` works. If not, change it to
`-lfftw3_threads` in `Makefile`.

Enter `make` in terminal to compile the programs.

## Run the test programs
4 executables will be generated by `make`:
- `welch-fftw` runs Welch's method with regular FFTW routines.
- `welch-fftw-openmp` runs Welch's method using FFTW with OpenMP enabled.
If the compilation flag `-lfftw3_omp` is changed to `-lfftw3_threads`,
fftw3 would actually run a mutli-threaded FFT implementation that does not
use OpenMP.
- `welch-cufft` runs Welch's method with cuFFT.
- `welch-cufft-openmp` forks several threads of Welch's method with cuFFT.

If a program crashes (especially welch-cufft-openmp on a CPU with 16+
cores), just try it again and it will run properly. Programs may run
slower at the first time, but subsequent runs will produce stable results.
